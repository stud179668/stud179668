Hello I am Naveen, a Masters student at the University of Stuttgart. I am studying Electrical Engineering, specialized in Smart Information Processing. I am very much interested in development of Embedded Systems, specifically designing VHDL for FPGAs and C/C++ for Microcontrollers.
I spend my time learning variety of topics, such as
  - Automotive camera signal processing, MIPI protocol, image processing and high speed electronics.
  - Automotive ethernet, Software defined networking and related security concepts (Cryptography has been a new interest).

With several years of professional experience in Aerospace and Automotive industries, I have gained skills in various stages of product development life cycle from requirements phase until certification of complex systems.
